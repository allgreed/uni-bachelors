2 players running the same algorithm (turn)
turn is atomic

player is actually a sequence of moves

algo is:
- print board
- check status
- move

- print board must happen BEFORE move
- check status must happen BEFORE move

- board is a bool <- it's finished or not
- move can change a board to true or false (undeterministically)
- after 9 moves a board will be false regardless of moves

- when board is false -> END_TURN; END_ALGO;
- after move -> END_TURN;
